## Nino's Inspiration
As a box office representative at a 4 diamond hotel and casino, artists would sell their merchandise at our venues, and the venue would take a cut from the merchandise sold. Us box office reps are tasked with counting in and counting out the inventory. We then have to calculate the gross income for each item, while accounting for comps, accounting for taxes, fees, as well as finding how much was owed to the casino, how much the artist kept, and the list goes on. It took us hours to do all of this by hand on a notepad and it also wasn't always accurate. This meant having to not only find the mistake, which cost the seller, casino, and employee time and money, but also diminished the credibility of the representative, which made settling more difficult. Thus Nino was born.
